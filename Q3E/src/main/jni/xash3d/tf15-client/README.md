To run TF15-Client you need the latest developer build of Xash3D FWGS, which you can get [here](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous).
You have to own the [game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/20/Team_Fortress_Classic/) and copy `valve` and `tfc` folders into your Xash3D FWGS directory.
